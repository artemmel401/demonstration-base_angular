This project was invented and created with last Angular version 18.0.6.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` and using with pleasure:)

When creating the application, I used  `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. I could use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

To track the keystrokes of shift + s, I studied and put into practice a tool such as a directive. It was difficult, but I was able to figure it out.

## Build

To launch the application, I used docker to deploy the application quickly and conveniently. Use the docker-compose up -d command and everything will start :)
